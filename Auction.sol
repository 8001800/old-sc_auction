/*
    Two phase auction:
    1. purchase phase
        * begins when startAuction() is executed by owner, ends when process bid phase begins
        * initial and incremental deposits must be equal or greater than the minimum deposit defined at contract deployment
        * buyers submit deposits on-chain
        * buyers submit signed bids off-chain (a total bid amount in WEI and a max price per token)
    2. process bid phase
        * ends when auction ends
        * strike price must be set before off-chain signed bids can be processed
        * when all bids have been processed, owner can call completeSuccessfulAuction to end auction
        * the auction will fail if success conditions are not met in the time allotted for the auction

    Auction success conditions (defined at contract deployment) :
        * amount raised is between a minimum and maximum WEI amount
        * tokens sold are between a minimum and maximum number of tokens

    A successful auction occurs when all conditions are satisfied and the owner calls completeSuccessfulAuction() before the auction ends.
    If an auction fails, buyers can withdraw their deposit and no tokens are distributed - tokens can be returned to the token minting contract by calling returnTokens().

    Withdrawl :
        * buyers withdraw by calling withdraw()
            * a successful auction results in :
                * transfer of remaining deposit to buyer
                * transfer of sold tokens to buyer
            * a failed auction provides the buyer with a full deposit withdrawl

    Other contraints set at deployment :
        * minimum buyer deposit (applied to initial and incemental deposits)
        * maximum bonus token percentage that can be applied to a bid

    NOTES :
    * optimized for clarity and simplicity
    * blocks that represent state transitions include the definitional block
    * only one category of inequality operands is used
    * use block number to measure time
    * two types of auction state transitions - active & passive
        * active state transitions triggered by contract owner
        * passive state transitions define auction phases as the block height increases
    * inspired by Nick Johnson's auction contract : https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/b9886ef91d5b47c31d2e3c8022eeea27
    * meant to be instructive yet practical - please improve on this!
